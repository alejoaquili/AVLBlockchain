#Blockchain
this project aims to reppresent an AVL tree using a blockchain for it

##Data structures:

##- AVL:
    The AVL tree structure.
    consist of two classes:
###AVLOperationData 
    which are then store as blocks of a blockchain
    
###AVLTree:
    which consist of a tree structure
    
    
    
##- Blockchain:
    The Blockchain data structure.
###Block:
    represent a block of the blockchain.
    it consist of a nounce, data,prevhash and next hash
        
###Blockchain:
    This represents a blockchain object.

###HashFunction:
    This class is a interface between the cryptofunction included in java
